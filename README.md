# that cat inside the tape
##### Hi, "that cat inside a tape" it's a project of mine, a 16 yo highschooler from Mexico, to post all kinds of art-related stuff in an anonymous way. Right now I just got some music, that I'll link down below, but soon I may upload poems, drawings, photographs, or whatever that comes to my head. Tysm for getting up to here c: (started in 05/07/2022)
